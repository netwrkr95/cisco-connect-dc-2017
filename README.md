# cisco-connect-dc-2017

The examples in this repo were demonstrated at a Cisco Connect conference in Washingtonton DC in October 2017.  The sample app is leveraging the YANG Development Kit (https://developer.cisco.com/site/ydk/ ) for Python, to automate the configuration of an Ethernet interface for an IPv4 address, mask, and VRF forwarding capability.  The router used is a Cisco CSR running XE 16.6.1.

The examples also include the output for the XML configuration from the YANG model used, as well as the .txt output from the router configuration.  A diagram of the basic test setup is also included.
